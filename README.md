* Out of the Vine reviews, 56.67% were 5-star revieww; 56.72 of the non-Vine reviews were 5-star. 

## Summary
Overall, it does not appear that there is a positivity bias when it comes to Vine reviews as opposed to non-Vine reviews, since both had a very similar percentage of 5-star reviews, with the non-Vine reviews having a slightly higher percentage (by .05 percentage points). An additional analysis that could be used to support this statement would be the perform the same one on another product dataset (i.e. video game reviews) to confirm if it would yield similar results.
